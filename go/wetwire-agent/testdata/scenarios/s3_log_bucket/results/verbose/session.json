I've been reading about using S3 for log storage since it's cost-effective for this use case.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is an S3 bucket specifically for storing application logs. These logs contain things like request/response data, error traces, and user activity logs. Nothing super sensitive like passwords, but we should still treat it as internal data.\n\nI'm concerned about a few things:\n1. Security - we definitely don't want these logs publicly accessible\n2. Cost - logs can grow quickly, so I want to make sure we're not overpaying\n3. Compliance - our security team mentioned something about encryption requirements\n\nCan you help me set this up properly? I want to make sure I'm following best practices. Let me know if you need any other information about our setup.\n",
